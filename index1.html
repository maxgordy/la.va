                “It’s usually better received when we're trying to help the homeless veterans to get housing, because people see them as having earned [the right to housing] because they have given the biggest sacrifice. 
                <br>
                When we think about the civilian population, if we see housing as something that has to be earned, then the question is what they have done to earn it in comparison to what a veteran has done, which is fight for our country, right? 
                <br>
                There's nothing that can compare to that.”

                “Each administration since 2011 has been warned by the VA’s own Office of the Inspector General, federal courts, and veterans that they were not doing enough to house veterans in Los Angeles. Despite these warnings, the VA has not made good on its promise to build housing for veterans. Instead, it has continued leasing portions of the West Los Angeles campus to a private school, UCLA’s baseball team, an oil company, and other private interests. 
                <br>
                <b>The cost of the VA’s inaction is veterans’ lives</b> [...]

            <p>
                [...] Over the past <ins>five decades</ins>, the West LA VA has been 
                <ins>
                    infected by bribery, corruption, and the influence of the powerful and their lobbyists, 
                </ins>
                and 
                <ins>
                    enabled by a major educational institution in excluding veterans’ input about their own lands. 
                </ins>
                It has allowed the drastic reduction of the size of the original plot of land deeded in 1888 to be an Old Soldiers’ Home. 
                In a series of lengthy, renewable leases, the VA authorized leaseholders to build permanent athletic facilities after permitting these concrete structures to be built on veterans’ land, 
                the VA now points to the waste that would be incurred by tearing them down. In effect, the VA has quietly sold off these lands just as surely as granting a quitclaim deed. 
                The VA argues they are out of space, and that the lack of available acreage precludes any increase to the 1,200 units they have promised to open on the West LA campus by 2030."
